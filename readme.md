# 🧳 Traveling Salesman Problem Visualizer

This project is a web-based implementation and visualization of the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** using **Dynamic Programming** and **Dijkstra's Algorithm**, developed with **JavaScript** and **HTML**.

## 📌 What is the Traveling Salesman Problem?

The **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** is a classic algorithmic problem focused on optimization. The goal is simple yet computationally challenging:

> Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.

## 🚀 Features

- 📍 **Interactive City Selection**: Add cities/points dynamically through a graphical interface.
- 🧠 **Efficient Pathfinding**: Combines **Dynamic Programming (Held-Karp algorithm)** with **Dijkstra's algorithm** for shortest path estimation between nodes.
- 🧭 **Shortest Tour Calculation**: Automatically calculates and displays the shortest tour visiting all selected cities.
- 💡 **User-friendly UI**: Built using HTML and JavaScript for a smooth and responsive interface.

## 🛠️ Algorithms Used

### 1. Dynamic Programming (Held-Karp)
- Solves TSP in **O(n² * 2ⁿ)** time.
- Uses memoization to store results of subproblems.
- Efficient for small to medium number of cities.

### 2. Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Used for calculating **shortest paths between city nodes** (especially when not using Euclidean distances).
- Ensures accurate distance calculations in weighted graphs.
